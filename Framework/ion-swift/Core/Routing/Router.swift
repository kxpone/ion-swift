/**
 * The Router class is responsible for discovering remote peers (represented via the Node class) in the network (both directly and indirectly reachable ones),
 * and establish connections to those peers.
 *
 * In this implementation, this involves the following tasks:
 *
 * - Using of Reto Modules to discover direct neighbors and advertise the local peer (this is implemented in the IONRouter subclass).
 * - Distribution of routing information using a flooding algorithm.
 * - Building a link-state routing table based on that information.
 * - Computing reachability information about other nodes when new routing information is received and informing the delegate about changes in reachabilty
 * - Establishing connections to other peers, including routed connections
 * - Acting as a router for other nodes, i.e. forwarding data from one peer to another, without handling the data on the local peer
 * - Supporting multicast connections (computing routes, handling incoming underlying connections accordingly)
