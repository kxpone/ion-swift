/**
 * Connection objects can be used to send and receive data. They can be established by calling connect on a RemotePeer or the LocalPeer.
 * If necessary, routing will be used automatically if a remote peer is not reachable directly. The Connection object will also automatically attempt to reconnect to a peer, should a route become unavailable.
 * Furthermore, the Connection object will attempt to automatically upgrade the connection to the remote peer if a better route becomes available.
 *
 * Events
 * The Connection class gives access to five events, onConnect, onTransfer, onData, onClose, and onError. You can react to the events by simply setting a closure, e.g.
 * connection.onData = { data in print("received \(data.length) bytes") }
 * None of these events have to be handled, however, if you wish to receive data, you need to react to either the onTransfer or onData event.
 *
 * Sending Data
 * Data can be sent using the methods send(data: NSData) -> Transfer and send(dataLength: Int, dataProvider: (range: Range) -> NSData) -> Transfer.
 * The latter method allows you to generate data as it is sent, e.g. to load it from a file on demand.
 *
 * Receiving Data
 * The Connection class offers two means of receiving data that are mutually exclusive:
 * 1. Setting onData: the closure will be called whenever data is received. For each send method call on the remote peer,
 *    onData will be called once when the data is transmitted. This is a convenience method and does not give you access to any additional information about transfers.
 * 2. Setting onTransfer: This closure is called when a data transfer starts, i.e. before the data is transmitted.
 *    It gives access to a InTransfer object that allows you to respond to events (such as progress updates), and allows you to specify how the transfer should be received. It can also be used to cancel transfers.
