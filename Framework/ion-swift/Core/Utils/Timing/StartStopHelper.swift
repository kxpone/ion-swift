 * A RetryableAction should encapsulate some action that might fail or succeed after a certain delay. If it fails, or does not succeed in a specified time interval, it can be retried.

 * You have to notify the RetryableActionExecutor about the success or failure of the action by calling onSuccess() or onFail().
