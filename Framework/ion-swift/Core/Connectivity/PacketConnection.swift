/**
 * PacketConnections are used to send and receive packets. Packets used by Reto can be any data of any fixed length,
 * but the first four bytes always contain the packet's type.
 *
 * A PacketConnection encapsulates the idea of a logical connection. It adds an additional indirection between a Connection as provided by
 * the Reto API and underlying connections. This allows the PacketConnection to switch between different underlying connections, and even exist without
 * an underlying connection. This is the basis of features such as automatic reconnect, and offering automatic connection upgrades.
 *
 * Packets can be sent by calling the write() method. If data is currently written, or no underlying connection is available, the packet is buffered
 * until it can be sent.
 *
 * A PacketConnection can have multiple delegates. Amongt other events, the PacketConnection delegates the handling of packets to multiple delegates that implement
 * the PacketHandler protocol. The PacketHandlers may specify the packet types they are able to handler, the packet connection will call the according handler's
 * handlePacket method.
 *
 * The PacketConnection itself is agnostic of the different packet types, the introduction of new packet types and handlers does not require any changes
 * in the PacketConnection class. This allows Reto to split up different functionality of Connections into different classes,
 * e.g. the TransferManager and ReliabilityManager, which are both PacketHandlers.
